# BCRrepertoire_as03_adjuvant
This repository contains the code used to analyze BCR repertoire data for the manuscript "AS03 adjuvant enhances the magnitude, persistence, and clonal breadth of memory B cell responses to a plant-based COVID-19 vaccine in humans"

The file called "Changeo_processing.R" contains the code used to analyze clonal expansion of all BCR sequencing data from this study. All of the code uses the Change-O package developed by Gupta, Vander Haiden, et al. (see reference bellow):
